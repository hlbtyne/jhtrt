It enabled me to write a piece about the prevailing  level of inauthenticity in the production of audio drama, significantly that produced by BBC Radio  drama departments. I suggested that the BBC Radio drama production model was and is based  on the accountancy-led principles of Hollywood movie production, a process in which creativity is  never the primary consideration and in which every attempt is made to bamboozle the audience  by replacing authenticity with fakery. I develop this argument amongst caveats about the  necessary complicity between all dramatic production and the audience that perceives it, in which  the suspension of disbelief remains the essential ingredient of all drama. But I suggest that a  viable alternative approach to the studio-based, SFX-saturated, quick turnaround dramas  produced by BBC drama departments exists; the process of recording audio drama on location  with, yes, actors in costume et al. This way of working draws the audience closer to the story; the  production is richer, vibrant and most importantly, more realistic and authentic to the audience  because it mirrors their life experience. I refer to David Edgar’s idea that “drama has rules and  drama-makers need to know the rules, because the rules are the possession of the audience”.  And I conclude with speculative thoughts about how audiences know how and when the rules are being broken. Audience approval is essential because approval equals applause.
