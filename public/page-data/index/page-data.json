In March 2020 I lost 90% of my work and a planned period of research and development. The John Hodgson Theatre Research Trust Covid Response Grant enabled me to: reflect on and articulate my practice; research best practice in community theatre, place-based work and permaculture project design; reflect on the place of community theatre practice, what it means to be together and ideas of place and belonging in a post-pandemic world; and re-plan the proposed project in my hometown.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Thinking about theatre in a pandemic felt a little like trying to stick stakes in a landslide, over the 4 months of research the context was constantly changing.

I thought and wrote, noticing that everything I wrote already feels like a history piece.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"I mapped my 19 years of practice and identified common threads, noticing how I combine tools from theatre and performance, participatory democracy, community organising, activism, formal education and personal development. This enabled me to articulate more clearly what I do, and advocate for it. I thought a lot about artistry and craft and who gets to make work. I couldn’t make firm plans, it’s hard to do that when you don’t know where you are going to be living. My plans are inspired by Bethany Wells provocation – if social distancing is the site of our work – what do we make? I feel more strongly than ever that we need to localise artistic practice, grounded in social and environmental justice, to support people to process the collective grief and economic shockwaves of this moment.","spans":[]}],"card_subheader":[{"type":"heading5","text":"Anne Langford","spans":[]}]},{"card_title":[{"type":"heading4","text":"‘Untitled’","spans":[]}],"large_card_text":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"With the trust’s generous support during lockdown, I was able to sow the seeds for my new solo interdisciplinary semi-autobiographical theatre project.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"The project is about how white people might begin to take responsibility for anti-black racism and white supremacy as a culture, and is seen partly through the lens of my previous interracial relationship.

I have also continued my research through reading widely, noting with interest how white people interact and behave when racism is discussed, analysed or pointed out. This is a crucial element to how the eventual performance of this project is pitched to my audience, perhaps winning them over with humour and a friendly face so that when the grotesque arrives, we can go into it together.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"With the trust’s support I was also able to take an extraordinary workshop on making original solo autobiographical work with renowned theatre artist and performer Bryony Kimmings and begin applying some of the techniques I learned to the development of the project.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"My thanks and gratitude.","spans":[]}],"card_subheader":[{"type":"heading5","text":"Adam Clifford","spans":[]}]},{"card_title":[{"type":"heading4","text":"‘An Actor/Carer Scheme for the Performing Arts'","spans":[]}],"large_card_text":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"I was thrilled to receive the grant from the John Hodgson Theatre Research Trust.
