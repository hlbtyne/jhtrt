I have evolved a trio of performances, based on my queer experience of Covid-19, and designed to investigate the use of costume in a digital rather than a physical space. This has allowed me to consider how drag and other costumes work in a performance that is not operating in a physical space with a live audience. While everything feels possible in a digital sphere – assuming one is skilled with video-editing and creative camera work, that is – I believe it gives rise to very different possibilities and expectations.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"All three acts have been devised to exist in the digital space: I have no way of knowing when I may be able to perform in a live space again, and this is my chance to explore the transition from live to digital performance. Though these are speculative acts, I hope to investigate ‘what works’, in particular with relation to quick change costumes. While some of the magic may inevitably be lost in the digital space, there may well be a different kind of magic to discover – and that is what I would like to achieve.","spans":[]}],"card_subheader":[{"type":"heading5","text":"Joey Frenette","spans":[]}],"video_url_large":null},{"card_title":[{"type":"heading4","text":"‘Unruly Bodies’","spans":[]}],"large_card_text":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"This grant enabled me to engage in a personal practice of reorientation, and to delve further into collaboration with artist Serafine 1369 – Jamila Johnson Small. ‘Unruly Bodies’ evolved through our conversations, performances, writing and workshops, and from the unruliness – messy but inventive – of our joint thinking and social interaction.

Which spaces can host us? At a time when socially accepted behaviours are shifting drastically, where does unruliness belong?  Through our voices and dancing bodies we seek to find answers and to open up new worlds of meaning.","spans":[]}],"card_subheader":[{"type":"heading5","text":"Fernanda Munoz-Newsome","spans":[]}],"video_url_large":null},{"card_title":[{"type":"heading4","text":"‘Immersive Theatre’","spans":[]}],"large_card_text":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"‘We don’t want people to say: “I went to the theatre last night”, we want them to say “this happened to me last night”.

We wanted to uncover what exactly it is that draws people to interactive productions and, ultimately, what makes the most fulfilling immersive experience. As immersive actors ourselves, we found some of our findings very useful, particularly when it comes to direct audience interaction. Our data told us that, because this genre often requires its spectators to step outside their comfort zone, audience members are more comfortable when they feel an actor has built a relationship with them during the show. The actor needs to be open and sensitive, whilst having a good gauge of the varying degrees of confidence that exist among audiences. We were actually surprised to find that the majority of participants enjoyed the experience of being singled out in shows, that it made them feel special and more a part of the world.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Primarily, our survey taught us that immersive theatre is extremely accessible and, because of this, is only going to grow in popularity in the future. These non-traditional productions have proven to engage audiences that would not necessarily choose the theatre of performance art as a night out, and we believe that in these uncertain times, the inclusivity that comes with immersive theatre will be something to hold onto as we begin to rebuild this wonderful industry.","spans":[]}],"card_subheader":[{"type":"heading5","text":"Lizzie Grace","spans":[]}],"video_url_large":null}]},{"__typename":"PRISMIC_PageBody1Info_card","type":"info_card","fields":[{"card_header":null,"card_text":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"“Thank you ever so much for your support, generosity of spirit and very encouraging words...during a difficult time.
