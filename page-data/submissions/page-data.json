As immersive actors ourselves, we found some of our findings very useful, particularly when it comes to direct audience interaction. Our data told us that, because this genre often requires its spectators to step outside their comfort zone, audience members are more comfortable when they feel an actor has built a relationship with them during the show. The actor needs to be open and sensitive, whilst having a good gauge of the varying degrees of confidence that exist among audiences.

I suggested that the BBC Radio drama production model was and is based  on the accountancy-led principles of Hollywood movie production, a process in which creativity is  never the primary consideration and in which every attempt is made to bamboozle the audience  by replacing authenticity with fakery. I develop this argument amongst caveats about the  necessary complicity between all dramatic production and the audience that perceives it, in which  the suspension of disbelief remains the essential ingredient of all drama. But I suggest that a  viable alternative approach to the studio-based, SFX-saturated, quick turnaround dramas  produced by BBC drama departments exists; the process of recording audio drama on location  with, yes, actors in costume et al. This way of working draws the audience closer to the story; the  production is richer, vibrant and most importantly, more realistic and authentic to the audience  because it mirrors their life experience. I refer to David Edgar’s idea that “drama has rules and  drama-makers need to know the rules, because the rules are the possession of the audience”.  And I conclude with speculative thoughts about how audiences know how and when the rules are being broken. Audience approval is essential because approval equals applause.

I have written extensively as a means of exploring themes, developing ideas and articulating my thoughts, including receiving mentoring from Rachel Long, poet and founder of the Octavia Collective. I have also continued my research through reading widely, noting with interest how white people interact and behave when racism is discussed, analysed or pointed out. This is a crucial element to how the eventual performance of this project is pitched to my audience, perhaps winning them over with humour and a friendly face so that when the grotesque arrives, we can go into it together.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"With the trust’s support I was also able to take an extraordinary workshop on making original solo autobiographical work with renowned theatre artist and performer Bryony Kimmings and begin applying some of the techniques I learned to the development of the project.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"My thanks and gratitude.","spans":[]}],"video_url_large":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tHN4E1BHjKE"}]}],"image":null}}},"pageContext":{"rootQuery":"\n  {\n    prismic {\n      page(lang: \"en-gb\", uid: \"submissions\") {\n        quote\n        page_text\n        title\n        _meta {\n          uid\n        }\n        additional_page_text\n        additional_title\n        _meta {\n          uid\n        }\n        body1 {\n          ... on PRISMIC_PageBody1Info_card {\n            type\n            fields {\n              card_text\n              card_header\n            }\n          }\n          ... on PRISMIC_PageBody1Past_projects {\n            type\n            label\n            primary {\n              past_projects_title\n            }\n            fields {\n              project_date\n              project_description\n              researcher_name\n              video_url\n            }\n          }\n          ... on PRISMIC_PageBody1Large_info_card {\n            primary {\n              large_card_title\n              large_card_section_intro\n            }\n            fields {\n              card_title\n              card_subheader\n              large_card_text\n              video_url_large\n            }\n          }\n        }\n        image\n      }\n    }\n  }\n"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
