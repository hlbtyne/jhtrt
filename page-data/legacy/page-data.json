He remained its President and its inspiration until his death on 24 March 2020 at the age of 89. Donald began his theatre career in Bradford alongside Bill Gaskill, in a youth theatre founded by the teenage Tony Richardson. After training as an actor with Esmé Church, Howarth turned to writing and emerged as part of the ‘angry young man’ generation of playwrights. In the mid-1970s he served as Literary Manager at the Royal Court Theatre.  His plays include A Lily in Little India, which gave Ian McKellen an early leading role, and Three Months Gone which starred Diana Dors and transferred from the Court to the West End.","spans":[{"start":600,"end":622,"type":"em"},{"start":675,"end":692,"type":"em"}]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"John published a number of books – including, with Ernest Richards, Improvisation (published by Methuen and Co Ltd in 1966), Living Expression, also with Richards, (Ginn and Co Ltd, 1968),  Uses of Drama (Methuen and Co Ltd, 1977) and Mastering Movement: The Life and Work of Rudolf Laban (Routledge 2001).  He was researching a biography of Alan Ayckbourn when he died.
